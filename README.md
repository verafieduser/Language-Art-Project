# Language-Art-Project
Project that replaces words in a text with close synonyms and if none, with blanks. 
No repeats of words are allowed. 

Goal is to make this a continuous process where random words are selected every x time unit to be replaced or removed, 
instead of linearly as you go through the text from beginning to end.
